🚀 API Tracking Middleware

A lightweight Node.js + Express middleware to track API usage, duration, and request logs.
Built for developers who want visibility into their APIs without heavy overhead.

✨ Features

🔑 API Key Validation – Secure your APIs by validating requests with predefined API keys.

⏱️ Request Duration Tracking – Automatically logs how long each API request takes.

📊 API Usage Logging – Capture and store details like endpoint, method, status code, and response time.

🛠️ Easy Integration – Just plug it into your Express app.

📡 Monitor & Debug – Perfect for debugging slow APIs and monitoring performance.

🌐 Multi-Application Support\*\* – Can handle APIs from "two different external applications" as of now.

✅ It fetches logs from a backend, groups them by API, and visualizes daily status codes using intuitive icons (✅ green check for success, 🟡 yellow triangle for informational, 🟠 orange circle for redirects, ❌ red cross for errors).

📦 The project also integrates a custom NPM package created by me to simplify tracking and logging of API requests.

⚡ Installation
npm i apitrace
import { trackMiddleware } from "apitraces";
                or
const { trackMiddleware } = require("apitraces");
app.use(trackMiddleware({ apiKey: "hardcoded-test-key" }));
or
app.use(trackMiddleware({ apiKey: "9FrsPB3OQIZYP2h2qzF8UF" }));
